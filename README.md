# Biqz-Menu
Version: 1.0.124  

## Description
**Biqz-Menu** is a plugin that allows you to create menus in a super simple and fast way, using an easy-to-configure YAML file. The plugin is fully customizable thanks to the configuration file, which contains every type of message printed in chat.

Each menu has its own permission, so by using a permissions management plugin like **LuckPerms**, you can give specific players access to only certain menus.

## Features
- **Supports "MiniMessage" and "PlaceHolder"**  
- **Automatic Inventory Fill**: Choose an item to automatically fill the empty spaces in the inventory, so you don't have to manually place each item.
- **Automatic Border Fill**: Select an item to automatically fill the borders, compatible with all inventory sizes.
- **Custom Inventory Sizes**: Want a 27-slot inventory? You can do that!
- **Custom Heads**: Add as many custom player heads as you want!
- **Dynamic Player Head**: Easily add the viewing player's head to the menu.
- **Custom Color Codes**: Use highly personalized color codes thanks to MiniMessage compatibility.
- **Placeholders**: Insert all the placeholders you want!

## In-Game Actions
When clicking an item in the menu, you can trigger various actions:
- **`%menu% <menuName>`**: Opens a specific menu for a player, even if they don't have permission for it.
- **`%chat% <command>`**: Executes a command for the player who clicks the item.
- **`%write% <command> <name>`**: Allows a player to write another player's name in chat when they click the item, and then execute the command with the player's name at the end.
- **`%say% <message>`**: Prints a message in the chat for the player who clicks the item.
